Thank you for choosing Interactive Water 3D !

Interactive Water 3D is a complete solution to simulate realistic interactive water surface in 3d environment.

Requirements:
  => The tech rely on render target so unity pro is necessary.
  => High quality water animation rely on Vertex Texture Fetch (aka VTF), so SM3 and unity pro is necessary.
  => However VTF is optional, you can enable / disable it by "m_UseVTF" in script "IW3D.cs".

Setup Guides:
  => The core component is script "IW3D.cs". Please attach it to your main camera.
  => Then you setup all necessary inspectors on unity panel. Please refer to the demo scene.
  => In demo scene, I use layer name "Ignore Raycast" as the layer mask for objects that influences the water surface. You can change to your own layer name.
  => In demo scene, I use layer name "Water" as the layer mask for water surface.
  => The demo scene demonstrate all features, please refer to it for a usage example.
